    "### Local Maximum and Minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "This intent of this solution (which I never finished implementing) was to iterate through the array prices to locate the first minimum price, storing that value as 'bought' stock. From that location, the next local maximum in prices to occur is detected and stored as a sell price (checking first to see we have stock to sell). Once there is a sell price we compute profit and add it to the total profit from our transactions. We then continue the cycle and look for a minimum then maximum price, buying and selling until the array of prices is fully traversed. This implementation is cumbersome and requires many more steps than is necessary if one posseses a full understanding of the mathematics of the problem (as explained in the analysis section)."
